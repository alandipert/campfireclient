Cleaning up the stuff that calls HtmlUnit classes.  I'm sure it
could be a lot cleaner.

The full range of Campfire actions - multiple rooms, people
entering/leaving notifications, admin stuff, creating rooms,
deleting rooms.

Logging in as a Guest.

A Javascript API, so one could write clients and bots in JavaScript
and run them with Rhino.

An IRC proxy/translator, that masqueraded as an IRC server but was
really a CampfireClient.  Then, one could connect with IRC clients
to Campfire rooms.  Eggdrop anyone?
