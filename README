TECHNICAL
----------------------------------------------------
This package depends heavily on HtmlUnit and its multitude
of sub-dependencies; it works by emulating a browser,
scraping things from the DOM.  ConsoleClient uses gnu's Java
getOpt to parse command-line options.

It collects new messages by adding a hook into
Campfire.Responders, which dispatches alerts().  HtmlUnit
provides a mechanism for handling alert events, and the
client's ability to receive new messages is built on this.

The class tree is more or less built out, but little
actually functions.  Advanced things like being in multiple
rooms, receiving notifications about comings and goings of
people in the room, and changing user settings, have yet to
be implemented.  But it all kinda works :)
