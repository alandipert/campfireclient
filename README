QUICKSTART

So, this is all very early in development, but basically to 
get it running, you need to do this:
1. Download and install the latest HtmlUnit.  Make sure it 
works, and that your CLASSPATH is square.
2. Download and install gnu.getopt.Getopt.  Make sure it's 
in your CLASSPATH.
3. javac *.java
4. "java ConsoleClient" and you'll see the options you need 
to specify.
5. And you're off!

THE CLASSES

Right now CampfireClient does rudimentary things, and 
ConsoleClient extends it.
ConsoleClient is an example of how you might code future 
clients.

THE BASICS

The functionality of CampfireClient is pretty limited.
It works by basically screenscraping with HtmlUnit,
a headless 'browser emulator.'

It intercepts new messages by looking "hook.js,"
which adds a class to Campfire.Responders.  This class
listens for onMessagesInserted, and when it is called,
it calls alert().

HtmlUnit provides a mechanism for detecting and handling 
alerts,
and it is upon this functionality that CampfireClient is 
able to
get new messages.

TODO

There's a lot of things that could be implemented.  
Currently:
1. Message objects aren't really constructed correctly.
2. It's kind of a big hack.
3. It can't really handle being in more than one room.
4. I'm working on getting a build.xml for Ant going.
4. Much more.

THANKS

Thanks for downloading the software; I hope you're able to 
do something cool with it.
My dream is to have a CampfireClient that emulates an IRC 
server, so I can use IRC clients
(and bots) in Campfire chats.   
Let me know if you want to be a part of the project:
